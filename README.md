# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This contains data structuresa and algorithsm from the initial start of my journey to become
a software developer! I studied the book [Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)
after getting the basics of coding such as for-loops, classes, and others down. It really
helped me understand the fundamentals and deriving time-complexity. 

## Disclosure

About 90% of the code is written by me with assistance from the book, of course.
However, I was writing some of these before knowing good practice and citing the resources
that I used when I couldn't solve it on my own. For example, the Fibonacci Heap was
included in the book but just pseudocode, so I had googled a resource to properly implment
the data structure.
